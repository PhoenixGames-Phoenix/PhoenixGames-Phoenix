Hi thereðŸ‘‹
====
I'm Phoenix, a hobby developer that mostly codes in C#.
I also currently try to learn HTML/CSS and JS. One of my HTML projects is my new Github Page (https://PhoenixGames-Phoenix.github.io).

A lot of my projects are private, because they're really specific tools that aren't useful for anyone else, and i dont want people to see my unoptimized code that can only be used for the single use case it was made for
